# Rock-Paper-Sicssors-Game

Inside the RPS.py file, I created an ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors.

The game starts with the user have 5 lives 
for every round lost the player loses a life

You can find the official rules of the game on the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.
