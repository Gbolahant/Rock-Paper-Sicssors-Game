# Rock-Paper-Sicssors-Game

Inside the RPS.py file, I created an ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors.

The game starts with the user having 5 lives 

get the user input

generate a random choice for the computer.

compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).

then print feedback to the player

for every round lost the player loses a life

You can find the official rules of the game on the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.
